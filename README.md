# PathFollowerObstacleAvoiderCar
My First IOT project

This car runs on 2 principles:-
  * Path Following
  * Obstacle Avoiding

This car follows a black path (black tape). <em>IR sensors</em> work on path following. You can read more about IR sensor's working principle [here](https://www.electronicshub.org/ir-sensor/).

If the ultrasonic sensor identifies any obstacle within range, the car takes detour, and manages to get back on the path.
You can read more about <em>Ultrasonic sensors</em> [here](https://www.fierceelectronics.com/sensors/what-ultrasonic-sensor).
