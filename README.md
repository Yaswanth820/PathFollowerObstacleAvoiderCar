# PathFollowerObstacleAvoiderCar
My First IOT project

This car runs on 2 principles:-
  * Path Following
  * Obstacle Avoiding

This car follows a black path (black tape). IR sensors work on path following. You can read more about IR sensor's working principle [here](https://www.electronicshub.org/ir-sensor/).

Components Used:-
   * Arduino <b>NANO</b>
   * Four Motors - (300 Rpm Each)
   * Four Wheels
   * BreadBoard
   * Metal Base
   * L298N Motor Driver Module
   * Connecting Wires
   * Jumper Wires(M-M,F-M,F-F)
   * Two - 9V Batteries
   * Black Tape
   
  * Sensors:-
    * Two - IR Sensors
    * One - Ultrasonic Sensor
